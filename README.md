I was reading a blog article on 3d pixel art animation 
(Slynrd's Pixelblog #40 - https://www.slynyrd.com/blog/2022/9/25/pixelblog-40-3d-animation)

Specifically about a rotating cube with the illusion of light reflection,
and I thought it would be cool to try to recreate a similar animation effect with CSS.

This is the result!
